# Capstone For MS in Business Analytics

Here are my notebooks that I used for data collection and cleaning before exporting them into excel files for stakeholders.

Project Problem: 
Throughout my marketing career, I have seen marketing teams struggle with creating content and campaigns surrounding their industry and tracking their competitorsâ€™ content marketing efforts. With this capstone, I would like to provide a business (fictional) with a dashboard that allows marketers to do analysis as well as display seasonality, forecasting, and other predictive analytics. Through this, they will be able to plan for seasonal content and stay ahead of competition.

## PLEASE NOTE: 
In this file, it only shows the process of data collection and cleaning before forecasting in excel.
